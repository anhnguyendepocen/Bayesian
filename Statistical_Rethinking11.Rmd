by Richard McElreath

# 11.0 Monsters and Mixtures  

## 11.1 Ordered categorical outcomes  

### 11.1.1 Example: Moral intuition

R code 11.1

### 11.1.2 Desribing an ordered distribution with intercepts

R code 11.2

Figure 11.1. Re-descibing a discrete distribution using log-cumulative odds. Left: Histogram of discrete response in the sample. 

R code 11.3

Figure 11.1. Re-descibing a discrete distribution using log-cumulative odds. Middle: Cumulative proportion of each response. 

R code 11.4

Figure 11.1. Re-descibing a discrete distribution using log-cumulative odds. Right: Logarithm of cumulative odds of each response. Note that the log-cumulative-odds of response value 7 is infinity, so it is not shown.
