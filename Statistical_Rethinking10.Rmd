*Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*

# 10.0 Counting and Classification  

## 10.1 Binomial regression  

Figure 10.1. Chimpanzee prosociality experiment, as seen from the persepectiv of the focal animal. The left and right levers are indicated in the foreground. Pulling either expands an accordion device in the center, pushing the food tryas towards both ends of the table. Both food trays close to the focal animal have food in them. Only one of the food trays on th eother side contains food. The partner condition means another animal, as pictured, sits on the other end of the table. Otherwise, the other end was empty.

Figure 10.2. Model averaged posterior predictive check for the chimpanzee models. Along the horizontal axis, treatments are laid out. The vertical is the proportion of left lever pulls predicted (black) and observed (blue). Each blue trend is an individual chimpanzee. The shaded region is the 89% percential interval of the mean prediction.

Figure 10.3. Marginal posterior density of a[2], the intercept for actor number 2. Very many vary large valeus are plausible. Since actor number 2 alwaos pulled the left-hand lever, the data cannot discriminate among these large values, as all of them guarantee pulling the left-hand lever.

R code 10.19

Figure 10.4. Posterior prediction check for model m10.4, the chimpanzee model that includes a unique intercept for each individual. Each plot shows the empirical proportion of left pulls in each treatment (blue), for a single individual. The black line and shaded region show the average predicted probability and its 89% interval. Only four of the seven individuals are shown.

Figure 10.5. Posterior validation for model m10.6. Blue points are observed proportions admitted for each row in the data, with points from the same department connected by a blue line. Open points, the tiny vertical black lines within them, and the crosses are expected proprotions, 89% intervals of the expectation, and 89% interval of simulated samples, respectively.

Figure 10.6. Posterior validation for m10.9. The unique intercepts for each department, A through F, capture variation in overall admission rates among departments. This allows the model to compare male and female admission rates, controlling for heterogeneity across departments.
